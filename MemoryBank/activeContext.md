## Current Work Focus

- **Task:** Restructuring the `MemoryBank` to align with the Cline Memory Bank methodology.
- **Status:** In progress. The core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) are being created and populated with information from the old structure.

## Recent Changes

- Created the five foundational Cline Memory Bank files.
- Migrated content from `project-context/`, `ideas/`, `issues/`, and `code-snippets/` into the new, structured files.

## Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Migration:**
    - Update the main `MemoryBank/README.md` to reflect the new structure.
    - Archive the old memory bank files (`project-context/`, `issues/`, etc.) into a new `archive/` directory to preserve history without clutter.

2.  **Address Critical Bug:**
    - Immediately after the memory bank is restructured, the next development task is to fix the "Missing `MLXModels` Directory" issue documented in `progress.md`.
