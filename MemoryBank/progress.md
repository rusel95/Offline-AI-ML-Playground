# Project Progress

## What Works

- The basic application structure with three main tabs (`Chat`, `Download`, `Settings`) is in place.
- UI components for each tab have been created (`ChatView.swift`, `DownloadView.swift`, `StorageSettingsView.swift`).
- The conceptual architecture and technology stack (Swift/SwiftUI) are defined.

## What's Left to Build

- **Model Management Logic:** The core functionality for downloading, storing, and synchronizing models is incomplete due to the file system issue.
- **Chat Functionality:** The chat interface is not yet connected to a live model.
- **Settings Implementation:** The settings view is not yet functional.

## Known Issues

### ðŸ”´ Critical: Missing `MLXModels` Directory

- **Status:** UNRESOLVED
- **Problem:** The application fails to detect downloaded models because the expected directory at `.../Documents/MLXModels` does not exist.
- **Impact:** This breaks the entire model management and synchronization workflow. `ModelDownloadManager.swift` cannot function correctly.
- **Next Steps:**
    1. Implement logic to create the `MLXModels` directory on startup if it's missing.
    2. Verify that the model detection logic in `getDownloadedModels()` works correctly once the directory exists.
    3. Test the end-to-end model download and synchronization process.
