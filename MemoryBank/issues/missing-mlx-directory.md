# Missing MLXModels Directory Issue

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Tags:** bug, file-system, models, critical

## Problem
The MLXModels directory does not exist at the expected path:
```
/Users/Ruslan_Popesku/Desktop/Offline AI&ML Playground/Offline AI&ML Playground/Documents/MLXModels
```

## Impact
- Models not appearing as downloaded in the UI
- `synchronizeDownloadedModels` logic fails
- App cannot detect existing model files
- Model management functionality broken

## Root Cause
The app expects models to be stored in a specific directory structure, but the directory doesn't exist on disk.

## Expected Behavior
- Models should be named by their short ID in the MLXModels directory
- App should detect and list downloaded models
- Model synchronization should work properly

## Solution Status
ðŸ”´ **UNRESOLVED** - Directory needs to be created and model detection logic verified

## Related Files
- `ModelDownloadManager.swift` - Contains synchronization logic
- `DownloadView.swift` - UI that should display downloaded models

## Next Steps
1. Create the missing MLXModels directory
2. Verify model detection logic
3. Test model download and synchronization
4. Update UI to properly reflect model status
