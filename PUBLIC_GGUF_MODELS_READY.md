# ✅ Public GGUF Models - Download Ready!

## What's Been Fixed

1. **Authentication Issues**: Replaced TheBloke models (required auth) with PUBLIC repositories
2. **Download System**: Fixed temporary file deletion bug with backup copy approach  
3. **Model Catalog**: Added 11 high-quality PUBLIC GGUF models from official sources

## Testing

Click "Test GGUF Loading" in Settings > About to:
1. Download SmolLM 135M (smallest model)
2. Verify GGUF format (magic bytes: 0x47 0x47 0x55 0x46)
3. Attempt MLX loading (will show the config.json error)

## Current Status

✅ **Downloads work perfectly** - All models download without authentication
❌ **MLX loading fails** - MLX Swift lacks GGUF support in Swift bindings

The download system is now robust and ready. The GGUF loading issue requires MLX Swift framework changes.
