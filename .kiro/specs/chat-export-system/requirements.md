# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chat Export System feature will enable users to export, import, and manage their conversation history with AI models. This feature addresses the need for conversation persistence, data portability, and advanced chat management capabilities within the Offline AI & ML Playground.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to export my chat conversations, so that I can analyze interactions and share findings with colleagues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests conversation export THEN the system SHALL offer multiple format options (JSON, CSV, Markdown, PDF)
2. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as timestamps, model used, and token counts
3. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL provide file location and allow immediate sharing
4. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggest alternative formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to organize conversations into projects, so that I can manage different research topics separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates projects THEN the system SHALL allow custom naming, descriptions, and color coding
2. WHEN conversations are assigned to projects THEN the system SHALL support bulk assignment and project transfers
3. WHEN projects are managed THEN the system SHALL provide project-level export and archive capabilities
4. IF projects are deleted THEN the system SHALL offer to move conversations to other projects or archive them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a collaborative researcher, I want to import conversations from colleagues, so that I can continue or analyze their AI interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing conversations THEN the system SHALL support the same formats available for export
2. WHEN import is processed THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and model compatibility
3. WHEN imported conversations are loaded THEN the system SHALL preserve original metadata and formatting
4. IF import data is incompatible THEN the system SHALL provide conversion options or detailed error explanations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want to selectively export conversations, so that I can share only relevant parts while protecting sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting conversations for export THEN the system SHALL allow individual message selection and date range filtering
2. WHEN sensitive content is detected THEN the system SHALL offer automatic redaction options
3. WHEN partial exports are created THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and flow
4. IF redaction is applied THEN the system SHALL clearly mark redacted sections in exported files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a long-term user, I want to search through my conversation history, so that I can find specific discussions or information quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching conversations THEN the system SHALL support full-text search across all messages and metadata
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and provide context snippets
3. WHEN advanced search is used THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date, model, project, and message type
4. IF search yields no results THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or broader criteria

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to generate conversation statistics, so that I can understand my AI usage patterns and model preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL generate reports on conversation frequency, model usage, and topic distribution
2. WHEN statistical data is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide visual charts and graphs for easy interpretation
3. WHEN statistics are exported THEN the system SHALL include raw data and summary visualizations
4. IF insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL indicate minimum requirements for meaningful statistics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a backup-conscious user, I want automated conversation backups, so that I never lose important AI interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup is configured THEN the system SHALL allow scheduled automatic backups with customizable frequency
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL compress and encrypt backup files for security
3. WHEN backup restoration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide easy restoration with conflict resolution
4. IF backup fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and notify users of persistent failures
