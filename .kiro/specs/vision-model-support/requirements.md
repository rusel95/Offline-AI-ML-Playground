# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vision Model Support feature will extend the Offline AI & ML Playground to handle image-based AI models, enabling users to perform visual analysis, image generation, and multimodal interactions. This feature expands the application beyond text-only models to support comprehensive AI workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a computer vision researcher, I want to load and use vision models, so that I can perform image analysis tasks offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses available models THEN the system SHALL display vision models separately from text models
2. WHEN vision models are downloaded THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with MLX Swift vision frameworks
3. WHEN vision models are loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize appropriate preprocessing pipelines
4. IF vision model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about compatibility issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to upload images and get AI-powered analysis, so that I can understand image content and generate descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL support common formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
2. WHEN image analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL process images using selected vision models
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display results including descriptions, objects, and confidence scores
4. IF image format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL offer conversion options or format guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to combine text and vision models for multimodal interactions, so that I can create rich AI experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multimodal mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL allow simultaneous text and image inputs
2. WHEN processing multimodal requests THEN the system SHALL coordinate between text and vision models
3. WHEN multimodal results are generated THEN the system SHALL present integrated responses combining text and visual analysis
4. IF model coordination fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to individual model processing with user notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want image processing to remain completely offline, so that my visual data never leaves my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL perform all analysis locally without network requests
2. WHEN vision models are used THEN the system SHALL verify no external API calls are made
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL optionally delete processed images based on user preferences
4. IF network activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert users and provide offline-only mode options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an accessibility advocate, I want automatic image descriptions, so that I can make visual content accessible to visually impaired users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically generate detailed image descriptions
2. WHEN descriptions are created THEN the system SHALL include spatial relationships, colors, and contextual information
3. WHEN multiple images are processed THEN the system SHALL provide batch description capabilities
4. IF description quality is insufficient THEN the system SHALL offer alternative models or manual override options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to compare vision model performance on the same images, so that I can evaluate model effectiveness for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple vision models are available THEN the system SHALL allow side-by-side comparison on identical images
2. WHEN comparisons are performed THEN the system SHALL display processing time, accuracy metrics, and result differences
3. WHEN comparison data is collected THEN the system SHALL integrate with the performance dashboard
4. IF models produce conflicting results THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies and confidence levels
