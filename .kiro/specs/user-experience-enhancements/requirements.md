4. IF theme application fails THEN the system SHALL revert to the previous theme and display error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a multitasking user, I want split-screen and multi-window support, so that I can work with multiple models or compare results simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN split-screen is activated THEN the system SHALL allow side-by-side chat sessions with different models
2. WHEN multiple windows are opened THEN the system SHALL maintain independent state for each window
3. WHEN window layouts are arranged THEN the system SHALL remember and restore preferred configurations
4. IF window management fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback to single-window mode with user notification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an efficiency-focused user, I want smart suggestions and auto-completion, so that I can interact with models more quickly and effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing messages THEN the system SHALL provide context-aware auto-completion suggestions
2. WHEN suggestions are displayed THEN the system SHALL learn from user preferences and improve over time
