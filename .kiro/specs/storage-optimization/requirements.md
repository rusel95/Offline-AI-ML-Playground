# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Storage Optimization feature will provide intelligent storage management capabilities for the Offline AI & ML Playground, including smart caching, automated cleanup, model compression, and storage analytics. This feature addresses the challenge of managing large AI models efficiently on resource-constrained devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a storage-conscious user, I want automated cleanup of unused models, so that I can maintain optimal storage usage without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is configured THEN the system SHALL allow setting retention policies based on last usage date and frequency
2. WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL identify models unused beyond configured thresholds
3. WHEN models are marked for cleanup THEN the system SHALL provide user confirmation before deletion
4. IF cleanup would remove actively used models THEN the system SHALL skip them and log the decision

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance-focused user, I want intelligent caching of frequently used models, so that I can access my preferred models faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are accessed THEN the system SHALL track usage frequency and recency patterns
2. WHEN cache optimization runs THEN the system SHALL prioritize frequently used models for faster loading
3. WHEN cache is full THEN the system SHALL evict least recently used models based on intelligent algorithms
4. IF cache optimization fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard loading with performance logging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a device owner with limited storage, I want to see detailed storage analytics, so that I can make informed decisions about model management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL display storage usage by model, category, and time period
2. WHEN analytics are shown THEN the system SHALL include projections for future storage needs based on usage patterns
3. WHEN storage warnings are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for space recovery
4. IF storage is critically low THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest models for removal or compression

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an efficiency-minded user, I want model deduplication, so that I can eliminate redundant model files and save storage space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deduplication scans run THEN the system SHALL identify identical or similar model files using checksums
2. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL offer to create symbolic links or merge duplicate entries
3. WHEN deduplication is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain model functionality while reducing storage footprint
4. IF deduplication causes issues THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and error recovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want adaptive storage management, so that the system automatically adjusts to my device's storage constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN device storage changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust caching and retention policies
2. WHEN storage pressure increases THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest optimization actions
3. WHEN adaptive management is active THEN the system SHALL balance performance and storage efficiency
4. IF adaptive policies conflict with user preferences THEN the system SHALL prioritize user settings with notifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a backup-conscious user, I want selective model backup, so that I can protect important models while managing backup storage efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup is configured THEN the system SHALL allow users to mark models as critical for backup priority
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL compress models and verify backup integrity
3. WHEN backup storage is limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical models and provide rotation policies
4. IF backup verification fails THEN the system SHALL retry backup creation and alert users to persistent issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want storage quotas and limits, so that I can prevent the application from consuming excessive device storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quotas are set THEN the system SHALL enforce maximum storage limits for models and cache
2. WHEN limits are approached THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest cleanup actions
3. WHEN quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent new downloads until space is freed
4. IF quota enforcement fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide manual override options
