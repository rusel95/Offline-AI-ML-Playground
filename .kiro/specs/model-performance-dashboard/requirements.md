# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Model Performance Dashboard feature will provide users with comprehensive analytics and benchmarking capabilities to track, compare, and optimize AI model performance within the Offline AI & ML Playground. This feature addresses the need for data-driven model selection and performance monitoring in offline AI environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to view detailed performance metrics for each model, so that I can make informed decisions about which models to use for specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a chat session THEN the system SHALL record response time, token count, and memory usage metrics
2. WHEN a user navigates to the performance dashboard THEN the system SHALL display aggregated metrics for all used models
3. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show average response time, tokens per second, memory consumption, and accuracy indicators
4. IF a model has insufficient data THEN the system SHALL display "Insufficient data" message with minimum session requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to compare performance between different models side-by-side, so that I can choose the most efficient model for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple models for comparison THEN the system SHALL display a side-by-side comparison view
2. WHEN comparison data is shown THEN the system SHALL include response time, memory usage, model size, and quality scores
3. WHEN models have different capabilities THEN the system SHALL highlight compatibility differences
4. IF comparison includes more than 4 models THEN the system SHALL provide scrollable comparison interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want to see real-time performance indicators during chat sessions, so that I can monitor system resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat session is active THEN the system SHALL display current memory usage and response time
2. WHEN token limits are approached THEN the system SHALL show token usage warnings
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL display performance alerts
4. IF memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL recommend model optimization actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export performance data, so that I can conduct external analysis and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate CSV files with performance metrics
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, model identifiers, and all recorded metrics
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide file location and success confirmation
4. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to set performance thresholds and alerts, so that I can maintain optimal system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures performance thresholds THEN the system SHALL save custom alert settings
2. WHEN thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger visual and optional audio alerts
3. WHEN alerts are active THEN the system SHALL provide clear remediation suggestions
4. IF multiple thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL prioritize alerts by severity level
