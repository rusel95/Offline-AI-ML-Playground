# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Download Manager feature will enhance the existing download system with resume capabilities, compression options, search functionality, and batch operations. This feature addresses user needs for more robust and efficient model acquisition and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with unreliable internet, I want to resume interrupted downloads, so that I don't have to restart large model downloads from the beginning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a download is interrupted THEN the system SHALL save partial download progress and metadata
2. WHEN a user restarts an interrupted download THEN the system SHALL resume from the last completed byte
3. WHEN resuming downloads THEN the system SHALL verify file integrity of existing partial data
4. IF partial data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL restart the download with user notification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a storage-conscious user, I want to compress downloaded models, so that I can store more models on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables compression THEN the system SHALL offer compression level options (fast, balanced, maximum)
2. WHEN compression is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain model functionality while reducing file size
3. WHEN compressed models are loaded THEN the system SHALL decompress transparently without user intervention
4. IF compression fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to uncompressed storage with user notification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to search and filter available models, so that I can quickly find models suitable for my specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the system SHALL filter models by name, description, and capabilities
2. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL support filtering by size, type, provider, and performance metrics
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and show relevance scores
4. IF no results match THEN the system SHALL suggest similar models or broader search terms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to download multiple models simultaneously, so that I can efficiently acquire several models at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple models THEN the system SHALL offer batch download options
2. WHEN batch downloads are active THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent downloads with configurable limits
3. WHEN downloads complete THEN the system SHALL provide batch completion summary with success/failure status
4. IF bandwidth limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue downloads and provide estimated completion times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to schedule downloads for off-peak hours, so that I can manage bandwidth usage effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user schedules downloads THEN the system SHALL allow time-based scheduling with repeat options
2. WHEN scheduled downloads start THEN the system SHALL send notifications and show progress
3. WHEN scheduling conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize downloads based on user-defined rules
4. IF scheduled downloads fail THEN the system SHALL retry according to configured retry policies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a model curator, I want to organize downloaded models into collections, so that I can manage models by project or use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates collections THEN the system SHALL allow custom naming and descriptions
2. WHEN models are added to collections THEN the system SHALL support multiple collection membership
3. WHEN collections are managed THEN the system SHALL provide bulk operations (move, delete, export)
4. IF collections become empty THEN the system SHALL offer to delete or keep empty collections
