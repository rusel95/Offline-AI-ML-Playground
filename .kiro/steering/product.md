# Product Overview

**Offline AI & ML Playground** is a production-ready iOS application that enables users to run open-source AI models locally on their devices using Apple's MLX Swift framework.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Complete offline functionality** - Chat with AI models without network dependency after download
- **Apple Silicon optimization** - Leverages MLX Swift for hardware-accelerated inference
- **Privacy-first approach** - All processing happens on-device
- **Model comparison platform** - Test and evaluate different AI models to choose the best fit

## Key Features
- Real-time streaming chat interface with 21+ curated AI models
- Smart local caching system with intelligent download management
- Support for multiple model formats (GGUF, SafeTensors, MLX native)
- Memory-efficient processing with automatic cleanup
- Native SwiftUI interface optimized for iPhone and iPad

## Target Users
- iOS developers experimenting with local AI
- AI enthusiasts wanting offline model testing
- Privacy-conscious users avoiding cloud-based AI services
- Researchers comparing model performance on mobile devices

## Technical Constraints
- **iOS 15.0+ required**
- **Physical device only** - MLX Swift doesn't support iOS simulators
- **Apple Silicon recommended** for optimal performance
- **2GB+ storage** required for model downloads
