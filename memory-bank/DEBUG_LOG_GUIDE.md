## ❌ ERROR PATTERN LOGS TO WATCH FOR

### Authentication Errors (SOLVED)
```
❌ Download failed: Invalid username or password.
📊 HTTP Status: 401
   🔍 Error details: HTTP 401 - Repository requires authentication
```

### File Not Found Errors (SOLVED)
```
❌ Model loading failed: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=260 "The file "config.json" couldn't be opened because there is no such file."
   NSFilePath=/path/to/Models/models/mlx-community/gpt2-4bit/config.json
```

### State Management Errors (SOLVED)
```
Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed, this will cause undefined behavior.
```

### Small Download Errors (SOLVED)
```
⚠️ WARNING: Downloaded file is very small (15 bytes)
   This might be an error page or redirect instead of the actual model
📄 File content preview: {"error":"Not Found"}
```

## 🎯 WHAT TO COPY AND SEND TO CLAUDE

### For Download Issues:
1. Copy ALL logs from "Started downloading model" to "Successfully downloaded model" 
2. Include HTTP status codes and file sizes
3. Include any error messages with full stack traces

### For Loading Issues:
1. Copy ALL logs from "Loading model for inference" to "Model loaded successfully"
2. Include configuration creation logs
3. Include any MLX container loading errors

### For Generation Issues:
1. Copy ALL logs from "Generating real AI response" to "Text generation completed"
2. Include prompt and parameters
3. Include any inference errors

### For State Management Issues:
1. Copy ALL "Publishing changes from within view updates" warnings
2. Include surrounding context (what action triggered it)
3. Include file synchronization logs

## 🔍 LOG SEARCH COMMANDS

### In Xcode Console:
```bash
# Search for download issues
grep -E "(⬇️|🔗|❌|✅).*download"

# Search for loading issues  
grep -E "(🔄|🚀|❌|🎉).*load"

# Search for HTTP errors
grep -E "(HTTP|401|404|302)"

# Search for file system issues
grep -E "(📁|FileManager|fileExists)"

# Search for state management warnings
grep -E "Publishing changes"
```

## 📊 SUCCESS VS FAILURE INDICATORS

### ✅ SUCCESS PATTERNS
- HTTP 302 redirects (not 401/404)
- File sizes in MB/GB range (not bytes)
- "Model container loaded successfully"
- "Text generation completed"
- No "Publishing changes from within view updates" warnings

### ❌ FAILURE PATTERNS  
- HTTP 401 "Invalid username or password"
- HTTP 404 "Entry not found" 
- File sizes under 1KB (error pages)
- "config.json not found" errors
- "Publishing changes from within view updates" warnings
- App hangs during file operations

## 🚨 EMERGENCY DEBUG PROTOCOL

**If something breaks:**

1. **IMMEDIATELY copy the entire Xcode console output**
2. **Filter for the relevant workflow (download/loading/generation)**
3. **Include 20 lines before and after any error messages**
4. **Note exactly what user action triggered the issue**
5. **Send to Claude with context: "Issue during [download/loading/generation]"**

This logging system captures EVERY step of the file storage, downloading, and memory loading process. No detail is too small - when you send logs, Claude will know exactly what went wrong and where.
