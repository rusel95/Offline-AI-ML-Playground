# Project Progress

**Date:** 2025-07-21
**Tags:** progress, status, issues

## What Works

- The basic application structure with three main tabs (`Chat`, `Download`, `Settings`) is in place.
- UI components for each tab have been created (`ChatView.swift`, `DownloadView.swift`, `StorageSettingsView.swift`).
- The conceptual architecture and technology stack (Swift/SwiftUI) are defined.
- Models directory creation and basic file system operations are working.

## Current Critical Issues (Discovered from User Logs)

### ðŸ”´ Critical: Fake Model Downloads
- **Status:** CONFIRMED BUG
- **Problem:** Downloads show as instant completion for 1.1GB+ models, which is impossible. Static model lists are being used instead of real HuggingFace API integration.
- **Evidence:** User logs show "âœ… Successfully downloaded model: gemma-2b" immediately, but actual network download happens later in chat tab.
- **Impact:** Users think models are downloaded locally but they're not, causing unexpected network usage and long loading times in chat.

### ðŸ”´ Critical: Model Configuration Mismatch  
- **Status:** CONFIRMED BUG
- **Problem:** User selects "Gemma 2B" but inference manager loads "mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit" configuration.
- **Evidence:** Logs show configuration mismatch between UI selection and actual model loading.
- **Impact:** Wrong models are loaded, causing confusion and poor user experience.

### ðŸ”´ Critical: Network Downloads in Chat Tab
- **Status:** CONFIRMED BUG  
- **Problem:** Despite showing models as "downloaded", chat tab still downloads from internet when loading models.
- **Evidence:** User reports seeing network traffic and time delays when starting chat.
- **Impact:** Violates offline-first principle and causes unexpected data usage.

### ðŸ”´ Critical: Path Inconsistency
- **Status:** CONFIRMED ISSUE
- **Problem:** Code uses `/Documents/Models` but memory bank references `/Documents/MLXModels`.
- **Evidence:** Logs show Models directory being used, but previous documentation mentioned MLXModels.
- **Impact:** Potential confusion and inconsistent behavior across app components.

## What's Left to Build

- **Real Model Download Logic:** Replace static model lists with actual HuggingFace API integration and real file downloads.
- **Proper Model-Configuration Mapping:** Ensure downloaded model files are correctly mapped to inference configurations.
- **True Offline-First Chat:** Chat functionality must work purely from local files without any network requests.
- **Model File Verification:** Implement proper checks to ensure downloaded models are complete and valid.

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Replace static model definitions with real HuggingFace model checking and downloading.
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Fix model configuration mapping to use actual downloaded model files.
3. **IMMEDIATE:** Remove any network requests from chat tab - must be purely offline after download.
4. **VERIFY:** Test complete workflow - download model â†’ chat works offline.
