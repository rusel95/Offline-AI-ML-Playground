**Tags:** active, current, focus

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- **Task:** All critical download/chat bugs have been resolved
- **Status:** SUCCESS. The offline AI&ML playground is now fully functional with real downloads and offline-first chat.

## All Critical Issues - RESOLVED ✅

1. **Fake Downloads:** ✅ FIXED - Replaced static model lists with real HuggingFace API verification and downloads
2. **Model Mismatches:** ✅ FIXED - Implemented proper model configuration mapping in `createModelConfigurationForDownloadedModel()`
3. **Network Usage in Chat:** ✅ FIXED - Added strict offline-first behavior with local-only model loading
4. **Authorization Errors:** ✅ FIXED - Updated to ungated model repos with proper error handling for gated models
5. **ProgressView Bounds:** ✅ FIXED - Added value clamping to prevent out-of-bounds warnings

## Key Improvements Implemented

✅ **Real Download System:**
- Proper HuggingFace URL construction
- HTTP error detection (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, etc.)
- File size validation (rejects downloads < 1MB)
- Progress tracking and speed monitoring

✅ **Offline-First Architecture:**
- Chat tab only uses locally downloaded models
- No network fallback in inference manager
- Local file existence checks before model loading
- Clear separation between download and chat functionality

✅ **Robust Error Handling:**
- Authentication failure detection
- Network connectivity checks
- File system error handling
- User-friendly error messages with actionable feedback

✅ **Model Mapping System:**
- Dynamic configuration creation based on downloaded models
- Proper ID mapping between AIModel and MLX configurations
- Support for different model formats and providers

## Recent Changes

**📁 Files Modified:**
- `SharedModelManager.swift` - Real download implementation with error handling
- `AIInferenceManager.swift` - Offline-first model loading with proper mapping
- `PerformanceSettingsView.swift` - Fixed ProgressView bounds issue

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- Replaced static model arrays with dynamic verification
- Added async/await download functionality
- Implemented proper HTTP response handling
- Created model configuration mapping system

## Verification Status

**✅ Build Status:** Project compiles successfully with no errors
**✅ Download Flow:** Real HuggingFace downloads with progress tracking  
**✅ Error Handling:** Proper feedback for network and authentication issues
**✅ Chat Flow:** Offline-first model loading from local files
**✅ Model Mapping:** Correct configuration matching between download and inference

## Next Steps

The core functionality is now complete and working. The app provides:

1. **Working Downloads:** Real model downloads from ungated HuggingFace repositories
2. **Offline Chat:** Chat functionality using locally downloaded models only
3. **Error Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Working settings with memory usage tracking

Future enhancements can focus on:
- Additional model formats and providers
- Download resume capability  
- Advanced chat features
- UI/UX improvements
