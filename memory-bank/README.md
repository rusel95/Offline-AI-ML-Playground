# Vibe Development Memory Bank

A file-based memory system to track development progress, ideas, and context for the Offline AI&ML Playground project.

## Structure

The Memory Bank is organized into six core files, following the Cline Memory Bank methodology:

- `projectbrief.md`: The foundational document defining the project's core goals.
- `productContext.md`: Explains *why* the project exists and the problems it solves.
- `techContext.md`: Documents the technology stack, dependencies, and technical constraints.
- `systemPatterns.md`: Describes the system architecture and key design patterns.
- `progress.md`: Tracks what works, what's left to build, and known issues.
- `activeContext.md`: The most frequently updated file, tracking the current work focus and next steps.

An `archive/` directory holds the previous memory bank structure for historical reference.

## Usage

This memory bank is designed to be the single source of truth for the project. Before starting any new task, review these files to gain full context. Update them as the project evolves.
