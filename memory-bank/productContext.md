## Problem Space

Developers and AI enthusiasts need a simple, reliable way to manage and experiment with local AI models without relying on cloud services. Key challenges include:
- **Model Management:** Keeping track of downloaded models, their versions, and performance is cumbersome.
- **User Experience:** Interacting with models often requires command-line knowledge, lacking a user-friendly GUI.
- **Offline Access:** Lack of a dedicated tool for purely offline AI experimentation.
- **Performance:** Managing memory and storage for large models can be difficult.

- **A Great User Experience:**
    - A clean, intuitive interface with features like dark mode, custom themes, and clear progress indicators.
    - Drag-and-drop model installation for ease of use.

- **Robust Model Management:**
    - Tools for comparing, automatically updating, and optimizing models.
    - Batch operations and backup/restore functionality to streamline workflows.

- **Enhanced Chat Functionality:**
    - Persistent chat history, conversation export, and support for multiple sessions.
    - Custom system prompts and potential for voice I/O.

- **Optimized Performance & Storage:**
    - Smart caching, model compression, and background loading to improve performance.
    - Tools for managing storage and cleaning up unused models.
