# GGUF Loading Report - MLX Swift

## Summary
MLX Swift currently **cannot load GGUF files** despite having C++ support for the format. The Swift bindings do not expose GGUF loading functionality.

## Test Results

### 1. Public GGUF Models (Working Downloads)
We successfully updated the model catalog with 11 public GGUF models that don't require authentication:

#### Microsoft Models
- **Phi-3 Mini 4K Q4** (2.3GB) - `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf`
- **Phi-3.5 Mini Instruct Q4** (2.3GB) - `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-gguf`

#### Google Models  
- **Gemma 2B IT Q4_K_M** (1.5GB) - `google/gemma-2b-it-GGUF`
- **Gemma 7B IT Q4_K_M** (4.5GB) - `google/gemma-7b-it-GGUF`

#### Qwen Models
- **Qwen2.5 0.5B Instruct Q4** (325MB) - `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF`
- **Qwen2.5 1.5B Instruct Q4** (964MB) - `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF`
- **Qwen2.5 3B Instruct Q4** (2GB) - `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-GGUF`
- **Qwen2.5 7B Instruct Q4** (4.4GB) - `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF`

#### HuggingFace SmolLM Models
- **SmolLM 135M Q8** (135MB) - `HuggingFaceTB/smollm-135M-instruct-add-basics-Q8_0-GGUF`
- **SmolLM 360M Q8** (369MB) - `HuggingFaceTB/smollm-360M-instruct-add-basics-Q8_0-GGUF`
- **SmolLM 1.7B Q4** (1.1GB) - `HuggingFaceTB/smollm-1.7B-instruct-add-basics-Q4_K_M-GGUF`

### 2. Download System Status
‚úÖ **Downloads are now working perfectly** with the public repositories:
- Fixed temporary file deletion issue by creating backup copy in URLSession delegate
- All models download successfully with proper GGUF files (verified by magic bytes: 0x47 0x47 0x55 0x46)
- No authentication errors (HTTP 302 redirects work correctly)

### 3. MLX Swift GGUF Loading Issue

#### The Problem
When attempting to load any GGUF file, MLX Swift throws an error looking for `config.json`:
```
Error: The file 'config.json' couldn't be opened because there is no such file.
Path: /Models/models/{model-id}/config.json
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **C++ Support Exists**: MLX has GGUF support in C++ (`mlx/io/gguf.cpp`, `gguf_quants.cpp`)
2. **No Swift Bindings**: The Swift package doesn't expose GGUF loading functions
3. **Blocked by swift-transformers**: The library explicitly rejects GGUF files with "GGUF format is not supported"
4. **MLX expects MLX format**: The ModelContainer and LLMModelFactory only work with:
   - safetensors files
   - config.json metadata
   - MLX-specific weight format

### 4. Evidence from Code Analysis

#### swift-transformers blocking (Tokenizers.swift:92)
```swift
if header.starts(with: ggufMagic) {
    throw TokenizerError.notSupported("GGUF format is not supported")
}
```

#### MLX Swift Model Loading Path
1. `LLMModelFactory.load()` ‚Üí requires HuggingFace Hub structure
2. `ModelContainer.load()` ‚Üí expects config.json
3. `LanguageModelConfigurationFromHub` ‚Üí needs JSON configuration
4. No GGUF-specific loading path in Swift API

## Conclusion

The user was correct that GGUF was working previously - this suggests either:
1. They were using a different framework (llama.cpp directly?)
2. They had a custom GGUF loader implementation
3. They were using an older version with different behavior

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Download system works perfectly with public GGUF models
- ‚ùå MLX Swift cannot load GGUF files without custom Swift bindings
- üîß Would need to create Swift bindings for the C++ GGUF loader to make it work

## Next Steps
To make GGUF work with MLX Swift, you would need to:
1. Create Swift bindings for `mlx/io/gguf.cpp`
2. Implement a GGUFModelContainer that bypasses config.json requirements
3. Add GGUF-specific loading path to AIInferenceManager

Without these changes, MLX Swift can only load models in MLX/safetensors format with proper config.json files.
